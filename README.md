# Dataset for 'Novel high-resolution data to unravel distribution, mechanisms and anthropogenic threats to global aquatic macrophytes'

## Datasets

**Datasets_1** Grid identity (grid_id), latitude (lat), longitude (lon), richness of all species (all_richness), and each range size quartile (range size decreased from Widespread group to Highly restricted group), continent, enviromental varaibles, and simulated species richness based on the middomain model at the continental (MDE_continent) and global scale (MDE_globe) in each grid cell. 

**Datasets_2** Overview of grid attributes in South America with downscaled distribution data from floras included (Dataset 2)

**species_list.csv** The taxonomic status and range size for each aquatic macrophytes.
